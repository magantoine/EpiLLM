During photic stimulation, the EEG shows time locked bi-frontally predominant myogenic activity which increases in amplitude as the frequency of stimulation is increased. Which of the following is most associated with this finding?\n",

    "Answer : - EEG testing on a 38-year-old man after his first seizure reveals a distinct pattern during photic stimulation: time-locked bi-frontally predominant myogenic activity.\n",
    "    - This myogenic activity signifies muscle-related responses triggered by the light stimulation, with the amplitude increasing as the stimulation frequency rises.\n",
    "    - Considering possible associations, option A, which suggests an underlying predisposition to generalized seizures, appears most relevant given the observed EEG pattern.\n",
    "    - Options B and C, relating to anxiety, substance withdrawal, or provoked seizures, seem less directly connected to the specific muscle-related response observed during EEG testing.\n",
    "    - Option D introduces a different phenomenon, a photochemical reaction, which doesn't align with the observed myogenic activity during photic stimulation. Therefore, option A is the most suitable interpretation of the findings.\n",

    "    - Options A, B, C, and D represent different types of epilepsy with identifiable lesions or specific areas of the brain affected\n",
    "    - Option E, nonlesional neocortical epilepsy, stands out as it refers to epilepsy without a detectable lesion in the neocortex, which  makes surgical intervention more challenging.\n",
    "    - The answer explanation emphasizes that the best surgical outcomes are typically seen in cases where there are clear lesions or identifiable epileptic foci, such as mesial temporal sclerosis, tumors, or hemispheric syndromes.\n",

    "Answer : - The question describes a 66-year-old woman with epilepsy secondary to a left hemispheric stroke, along with several comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones.\n",
    "    - The patient had a hypersensitive reaction to phenytoin, making it unsuitable for further use.\n",
    "    - Carbamazepine and primidone are potential options but pose challenges due to potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin and drug interactions with warfarin.\n",
    "    - Zonisamide carries a risk of kidney stones, which is contraindicated in a patient with a history of calculi.\n",
    "    - Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are not ideal due to their association with bone density loss, exacerbating the patient's osteoporosis.\n",
    "    - Among the choices, levetiracetam emerges as the most appropriate option due to its lower risk of hypersensitivity, minimal drug interactions with warfarin, and lack of exacerbation of osteoporosis or kidney stone formation.\n",

      "        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\n",
      "Answer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated.\n",

      "        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\n",
      "Answer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures.\n",

      "Answer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates).\n",

      "Answer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained.\n",

      "Answer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully.\n",

      "Answer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively.\n",

      "Answer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders.\n",

      "        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\n",
      "        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\n",
      "Answer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit.\n",

      "        D. male sex\n",
      "        E. partial-onset seizures\n",
      "Answer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended.\n",

      "Question :  A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\n",

      "        D. oral levetiracetam\n",
      "        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\n",
      "Answer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer.\n",

      "Answer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered.\n",

It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy.\n",

Her seizures are characterized by waking out of sleep with a groan, abduction of the left shoulder, and flexion of the left elbow with extension of the right upper extremity (fencer posturing), followed by hypermotor movements. The seizures are predominately nocturnal and frequently cluster. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed multifocal (bilateral frontal and left temporal) interictal spikes but no clear electrographic changes at seizure onset. Her T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan is shown in Figure 1. Invasive monitoring with stereo EEG electrodes confirmed seizure onset at electrode contacts in close vicinity to the lesion. Histopathology of the lesion is most likely to show:\n",

The diagnosis was made by fine needle aspiration biopsy and confirmed by histological examination after surgical excision with axillary lymph node clearance and radiotherapy treatment without chemotherapy because of the absence of metastasis at diagnosis time and good prognostic factors (low grade tumor). The evolution was marked by local recurrence at one year after surgery which required mastectomy followed by radiotherapy treatment without chemotherapy because again there were no metastasis at diagnosis time and good prognostic factors (low grade tumor).<EOD> .\n",
