      "            Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is characterized by brief episodes of loss of consciousness lasting 5 to 10 seconds, which may be accompanied by eye blinking or other movements. These episodes occur most commonly during sleep but can also occur while awake; they are usually brief and self-limited but can be prolonged or recurrent if untreated. JAE typically presents in adolescence rather than early childhood and has a strong genetic component.-user: Question : A 23-year-old woman presented for evaluation after having an episode of altered mental status while driving home from work one evening; she was found to have had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at the wheel of her car before losing consciousness for several minutes before being found by her husband who called emergency medical services (EMS). She had no history of prior neurologic symptoms or illnesses other than migraines that were treated with acetaminophen when needed; she denied any family history of neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer disease or dementia, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2/3/6/7/8/17, Friedreich ataxia type 2A , Machado Joseph disease , Charcot Marie Tooth type 2A , Kennedy's disease , spinobulbar muscular atrophy , progressive supranuclear p\n",

While polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders, it is not necessary in this case. Instead, the next step in management would be to wean off levetiracetam and monitor for improvement of his symptoms. If his daytime sleepiness persists after 2-3 months of being off levetiracetam, then other causes should be considered and further testing may be warranted.\n",
