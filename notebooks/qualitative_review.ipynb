Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation.

After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old man with a 10-year history of medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoes an evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall. IV access is obtained. He is initially at his baseline neurologic status but then develops generalized seizure activity that has lasted 5 minutes.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old man with a 10-year history of medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoes an evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old woman with a history of complex partial epilepsy has been treated successfully with topiramate for 2 years. She is contemplating initiating birth control and comes to discuss her options with her physician. Which of the following would be a reasonable contraceptive choice for this patient?\\n        A. contraceptive hormonal patch\\n        B. intrauterine device\\n        C. low-dose combined oral contraceptive with estrogen and progestin components\\n        D. progestin-only oral contraceptive pill\\n        E. vaginal ring\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is content with her antiepileptic drug, and there is no compelling reason to change it. Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

The presence of which of the following characteristics of her spells would be more suggestive of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ictal eye closure\\n        B. opisthotonic posturing\\n        C. side-to-side head movements\\n        D. stuttering quality of speech\\n        E. tongue biting\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Characterization of spells as epileptic or psychogenic (ie, nonepileptic) in nature can be challenging and often requires video-EEG monitoring, although aspects of the history often help to distinguish the etiology of the episodes. Of the options listed above, tongue biting (or other types of injury/trauma) would be most suggestive of an epileptic nature. Other factors that would favor an epileptic etiology include significant postictal confusion, occurrence in sleep, and incontinence. The other choices listed above would all be more suggestive of a psychogenic nonepileptic etiology. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###']]\n"

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old man with a 10-year history of medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoes an evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old woman with a history of complex partial epilepsy has been treated successfully with topiramate for 2 years. She is contemplating initiating birth control and comes to discuss her options with her physician. Which of the following would be a reasonable contraceptive choice for this patient?\\n        A. contraceptive hormonal patch\\n        B. intrauterine device\\n        C. low-dose combined oral contraceptive with estrogen and progestin components\\n        D. progestin-only oral contraceptive pill\\n        E. vaginal ring\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is content with her antiepileptic drug, and there is no compelling reason to change it. Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia.

As such, its utility as a test for distinguishing between epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizures has been widely studied. Elevations in prolactin are detected after generalized tonic-clonic seizures and to a lesser degree, focal seizures with impaired awareness. The levels peak rapidly after a seizure (eg. within 10-20 minutes, as long as 60 minutes) but then decay to baseline levels within 2-6 hours. However, it can be challenging to quickly obtain prolactin levels for outpatients if they do not present immediately after a seizure. In an review of pooled data, sensitivity up to 45% for a focal seizures and 60% for a generalized tonic-clonic seizure have been described for prolactin levels drawn in the immediate period after a seizure, with a specificity of up to 95% for distinguishing between seizure and non-epileptic events. Prolactin testing has not been adopted for widespread clinical use given that normative values depend on age, gender and circadian rhythm. Normal prolactin levels will not rule out epileptic seizure, nor rule in a non-epileptic event. In distinguishing between seizures versus syncope, prolactin levels are of low utility since syncope can lead to elevations in prolactin if levels are not measured in the immediate period after the event (eg. within 60 minutes after the event).',\n",

However, while an elevated prolactin level can support the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure, it is not specific to epilepsy and can be elevated in other conditions as well.

In both treatment trials, the stimulation targets the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Although the anterior nucleus of the thalamus remains the most popular target for DBS treatment, in the last several years several studies have explored the use of DBS targeting other brain regions. The most promising alternative target appears to be the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. In animals, the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus plays a role in seizure initiation, and stimulation of the nucleus leads to improvement in postictal return to consciousness. In several small human studies, stimulation of the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus led to median seizure reductions of 57-80%, although the studies conducted to date have been relatively small and have not been double-blinded controlled trials. The studies suggest that this form of stimulation may be more effective in patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or generalized epilepsies.

The psychotic episode can begin up to days after the seizure and there is often a reported \"lucid interval\" lasting up to a week during which the patient has apparently normal mental status. This makes post-ictal psychosis difficult to diagnose. The duration of the pyschosis can last 1 to 90 days. The pyschosis is characterized by altered consciousness, disorientation or delirium and syptoms vary widely from delusions and thought disorder to hallucinations (both visual and auditory), to paranoid delusions, to religious preoccupations and a feeling of impending death. Several studies have reported an associations between post-ictal psychosis and ictal/interictal epileptiform activity that is bilaterally independent. Most studies suggest a link between post-ictal psychosis and temporal lobe epilepsy. Case series of SPECT studies have shown increased regional blood flow over the right temporal neocortex. There are limited long-term follow up studies, but post-ictal psychosis can recur in a predictable and stereotyped manner and up to 25% of patients with post-ictal psychosis migt go on to develop chronic pyschosis.',\n",

[1] Yet, recently published evidence shows that EIS might be potentially as reliable as spontaneous habitual seizures (SHS) captured during intracranial video EEG monitoring. [1-3] This might ultimately lead to a more time-efficient intracranial presurgical investigation of focal epilepsy as the need to record spontaneous seizures could be reduced.\\n\\nKaempfer et al. published a retrospective review in 2020 looking at the video- and EEG-recordings of 65 patients who underwent intracranial monitoring and surgical resection for medically refractory epilepsy. [2] They only included surgical patients who had at least one EIS and one SHS captured during their intracranial EEG monitoring session and in whom the seizure onset zone (SOZ) of the EIS was also part of the final surgical resection. The level of semiological and EEG similarity of EIS and SHS was rated blinded to the surgical outcome.\\n\\nThe group found that postsurgical seizure freedom was observed significantly more often in patients with identical seizure semiology of EIS and SHS, than in patients with less similar or even different seizures (ILAE class 1 at last follow-up: 76% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). This finding held true even after correcting for confounders commonly associated with higher chance of post-surgical seizure freedom, such as lesional MRI, duration of epilepsy, location of suspected epileptogenic zone (mesiotemporal versus neocortical) and occurrence of multiple spontaneous seizures during intracranial monitoring. Interestingly, the association between seizure freedom rates and full concordance of EEG pattern of EIS and SHS was not significant, strengthening the assumption that concordance of EEG pattern is less important than concordance of SOZ and semiology of EIS and SHS.\\n\\nAnother retrospective study of EIS and SHS captured during intracranial video-EEG monitoring of 103 patients published by Cuello Oderiz et al. in 2019 showed that the percentage of patients with EIS was higher in the good post-surgical outcome group than in the poor outcome group (70.5% versus 47.5%; p \\u2009= 0\\u2009.02). [3] Further, the percentage of the resected contacts encompassing the SOZ of EIS significantly correlated with surgical outcome (median percentage in good versus poor outcome: 63.2% versus 33.3; p\\u2009 = 0\\u2009.003). Unlike Kaempfer et al. this study did not control for any potential confounders, but they pointed out that high-frequency stimulation (50 Hertz instead of 1 Hertz) and more-than-24-hour elapsed time since the most recent SHS were associated with a higher likelihood of EIS elicited during cortical stimulation.',\n",

Other presentations include paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and other epilepsy phenotypes outside of infancy including myoclonic astatic epilepsy in childhood. Seizures often seem to be noted prior to meals.

Although commonly referred to as the Intracarotid Sodium Amobarbital Procedure, medications other than amobarbital are being used to perform the test. In order to anesthetize one cerebral hemisphere, the ideal medication would have complete but short-lived CNS penetration, with minimal residual neurological effects and rapid clearance. Etomidate, Methohexital, and Propofol have shorter duration of action and thus can be considered, though there are some disadvantages. Etomidate often requires infusion or repeat dosing as it may be too short acting to complete the neuropsychological evaluation. Methohexital is known to induce epileptiform discharges in epilepsy patients, and in fact this can be used as an intentional maneuver during intraoperative electrocorticography. Propofol would suppress epileptiform discharges and thus is incorrect (it is used to treat refractory status epilepticus).

He also has risks factors for OSA in that he is male, of older age, and has intractable epilepsy. OSA is present in approximately 20 to 40 percent of adults with medically refractory epilepsy, and comorbid OSA has been associated with worsened seizure frequency. OSA is diagnosed using polysomnography, which is indicated in patients who report daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of OSA such as loud snoring, waking up gasping or choking, and witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep. The mean sleep latency test does evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness, but it tests more for excessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy and should follow polysomnography that has already excluded OSA. Even though sedation is a common side effect from levetiracetam, it is not likely to be the cause of this patient's sleepiness because he was on a stable dose of levetiracetam for the past 6 months and his symptoms began 2-3 months ago. Weaning off levetiracetam would not likely improve his daytime sleepiness and could worsen his seizure control.

Mutations in SCN1A can cause a spectrum of epilepsies, of which Dravet syndrome is one. The clinical features of Dravet syndrome include epilepsy onset before the age of 1 year in a previously typically developing infant, often but not always with a prolonged febrile or afebrile convulsion. Typical seizure types include hemiclonic (described above), generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and other generalized seizure types, though tonic seizures should not be a prominent type. Development and cognition may become impaired over time, and a patient with Dravet syndrome may develop a characteristic stooped gait; more severe motoric impairment would suggest a different disorder. Sodium channel blockers are contraindicated in Dravet syndrome because they have a high risk of worsening seizures. This is not true of all sodium channel disorders -- for example, in SCN8A epilepsy, high-dose phenytoin can be a highly effective treatment.',\n",

       "   'answer_full': 'Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF), also known as autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF), is an idiopathic focal epilepsy syndrome that has been associated with several genetic mutations, most commonly a mutation in the LGI1 gene. The main ictal semiology involves auditory symptoms and/or receptive aphasia. The auditory symptoms typically consist of unformed sounds, such as humming or ringing, but sometimes involve distortions (such as volume changes) or complex sounds (songs or voices). Ictal receptive aphasia consists of a sudden onset of inability to understand language in the absence of general confusion. Progression to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures occurs in most patients. Some may have reflex seizures, brought on by a specific sound. Age of onset is typically adolescence or early adulthood, but it can occur from early childhood to middle adulthood. Seizures are typically amenable to medical treatment.\\n\\nThe LGI1 gene encodes for leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), or epitempin, a protein that may regulate the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels and may be involved in neuronal growth regulation and cell survival. LGI1 variants have been identified in about 50% of families with autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features. Reduction in release of the LGI1 protein from excitatory neurons is thought to contribute to the occurrence of seizures. Most of the epilepsy-associated variants in LGI1 produce a premature stop codon, and others prevent secretion of the protein. Finally, some variants lead to impaired interaction of the protein with its target. Other genes that have been associated with this syndrome include DEPDC5 and RELN.\\n\\nCHRNA2 variants are associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. KCNQ2 pathogenic variants are associated with a spectrum of neonatal epilepsies, ranging from benign familial neonatal epilepsy to KCNQ2-related neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. Mutations of CDKL5 lead to a infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy. Mutations in the LIS1 gene lead to lissencephaly, a disorder of radial migration of neurons.',\n",

The symptomatogenic zone is the area of cortex that, when activated by an epileptic discharge, reproduces the patient's typical clinical symptoms. The area of cortex from which seizures can be objectively demonstrated to arise is the ictal onset zone. The functional deficit zone is the area that shows abnormal functioning during the interictal period and can be identified by clinical examination, functional neuroimaging, the Wada test, neuropsychology, etc. The epileptogenic zone is the area of cortex that is able to generate seizures and whose complete removal results in seizure freedom.

Therefore, investigation for a solid tumor is warranted in this patient, and treatment of any underlying tumor is part of the first-line therapy of this patient.

       "   'answer_full': 'Migrating partial seizures of infancy (MPSI) is an early onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by migrating focal seizures, psychomotor deterioration and a poor prognosis in terms of seizure control, neurodevelopmental outcome and life expectancy. MPSI is associated with mutations in a variety of genes, including PLCB1, TBC1D24, SCN1A, SCN2A, SLC25A22, and KCNT1. A gain of function in the potassium channel gene KCNT1 is the most common known genetic cause of MPSI. The antiarrhythmic drug, quinidine, which is a partial antagonist of KCNT1, was recently found to markedly reduce seizures in a patient with MPSI due to this mutation. Mutations in the glutamate receptor subunit gene GRIN2A are associated with an epilepsy-aphasia syndrome. Mutations of the DEPDC5 (DEP domain containing protein 5) gene account for 12 to 37% of inherited focal epilepsies, including familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and familial temporal lobe epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia. DEPDC5 is an upstream negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Mutations in KCNJ11 are associated with the DEND syndrome (Developmental delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes). Sulphonylurea treatment has been reported to be helpful in alleviating both the neurologic symptoms and diabetes in these patients.

Several studies have suggested an unexpected and relatively high rate of seizures with LRDA as well, though the association is not as strongly established as with LPDs. Like LRDA, GPDs also have an intermediate association with seizures, whereas GRDA has the lowest association. Additionally, the plus modifier also increases association with seizures (+F, +R, or +S which mean superimposed fast, rhythmic, or sharp activity, respectively). Admittedly, the standardized terminology has many levels of detail and precision that may or may not be used clinically day-to-day. However, the data consistently show excellent inter-rater reliability on the use of main terms 1 and 2 (as in each of the answer choices). Thus, it is suggested that, at a minimum, EEG reports should contain at least main term 1, main term 2, and the plus modifier, for any such rhythmic or periodic patterns of unclear significance along the so-called ictal-interictal continuum (“gray zone”). Of note, defining these patterns into a strict dichotomy of “are they or are they not seizure” is often not possible and can be misleading. In general, it is more practical to use the standardized terminology to describe the pattern, and then acknowledge these limitations and instead discuss their (relative) association with seizures and the resultant need for ongoing monitoring.',\n",

Of note, most of these predictors are not necessarily independent predictors; that is, EEG Should never be used alone in isolation for prognostication.

KCNT1 causes epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) previously known as malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI). Seizures are drug refractory and prognosis is poor. SCN1A is the most common cause of Dravet syndrome and GEFS+ (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus).

Unlike estrogen, which primarily acts by decreasing chloride conduction, progesterone has been found to increase chloride conductance at the GABAA receptor complex, promoting neuroinhibition. This effect is modulated primarily through the action of allopregnanolone, a neuroactive progesterone metabolite. Allopregnanolone has a neuromodulatory effect similar to that of a potent benzodiazepine and is much stronger than that of phenobarbital; however, it binds to a unique GABAA receptor site. It is therefore believed that progesterone, mainly through the action of its metabolites, has strong anticonvulsant properties.\\n\\nThe increase in seizure frequency during perimenopause is likely secondary to the elevation of the estrogen/progesterone ratio during this period.

When assessing the diagnostic accuracy of a screening tool it is important that a recognized reference or gold standard is used (for example, the SCID or the MINI), as opposed to another screening tool (such as the BDI), as this may result in an inaccurate assessment of depression. The screening tool does not have to be developed for people with epilepsy, but it should limit inclusion of somatic symptoms of depression that may overlap with side effects from medication or the disease itself.

The use of certain ASMs increases the risk of decreased bone density and abnormalities in bone metabolism. Hepatic enzyme inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and primidone, and noninducing ASMs such as valproate, are known to be associated with accelerated rate of bone loss and development of secondary osteopenia and osteoporosis with an increase in the risk for fractures. Limited evidence is available regarding the newer ASMs.\\n\\nMeasuring bone mineral density with dual x-ray absorptiometry is the most sensitive predictor of fracture in patients at risk. FRAX is an online screening tool used to calculate a patient's risk of low bone mineral density and fracture by evaluating a patient's prior bone health history and risk factors for bone disease. Plain X-rays are not typically used for fracture risk stratification.\\n\\nASMs may impact bone health via multiple mechanisms. CYP P450-inducing ASMs increase inactivation of vitamin D, leading to decreased intestinal calcium absorption. Hypocalcemia increases the levels of parathyroid hormone, in turn mobilizes the calcium from bone. ASMs may also directly impact calcium absorption from the gut, alter activity of bone cells and affect levels of hormones affecting bone such as estrogen, calcitonin, and insulin-like growth factor, and reduce calcium absorption by the kidney.

With respect to mechanism of action, it is preferred to choose drugs with different mechanisms of action to reduce side effects and potentially increase chance of success. Of the above choices, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine are all sodium channel blocking agents similar to carbamazepine. In addition, all three interact significantly with carbamazepine. Although vigabatrin works via a different mechanism of action (selective and irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase, resulting in a 5-fold increase of GABA in the entire brain) and does not interact with any other antiseizure drugs, it is mostly reserved as late add-on therapy for focal onset epilepsy due to concerns of peripheral vision loss (so-called vigabatrin attributed visual-field loss [VAVFL]). VAVFL can happen in up to 31% of patients exposed to vigabatrin - particularly with longterm use. That leaves topiramate as the best option: Although topiramate will interact with carbamazepine and has also sodium channel blocking properties, it is considered a relatively safe drug with multiple other mechanisms of action including enhancement of GABAa receptor-mediated inhibition, antagonism of glutamate at the AMPA/kainate receptors, inhibition of high-voltage- activated (L-type) calcium channels and a weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.',\n",

Seizures typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood. Focal aware seizures characterized by an intense déjà vu along with autonomic phenomena predominate. The autonomic symptoms include nausea, a rising epigastric sensation, tachycardia, sweating, flushing, and pallor. The seizures are mild and are relatively easy to treat. Patients generally have normal cognition. Febrile seizures are uncommon in this syndrome. The EEG is often normal or shows temporal slowing. The majority have a normal brain MRI, but mesial temporal sclerosis occurs rarely. All individuals with familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy must have seizures arising from the mesial temporal lobe. Auditory seizures in the patient's aunt would indicate a lateral/neocortical onset and raise the possibility of familial focal epilepsy with variable foci in this family. The genetics have not yet been well-established, but this syndrome has been associated with pathogenic variants in DEPDC5.\",\n",
