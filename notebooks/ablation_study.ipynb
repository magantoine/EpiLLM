Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms.

However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A patient with which of the following conditions should not be placed on a ketogenic diet?\\n        A. diabetes\\n        B. hyperlipidemia\\n        C. obesity\\n        D. pancreatitis\\n        E.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset.

Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n        A. focal cortical dysplasia\\n        B. neurofibromatosis\\n        C. Rasmussen encephalitis\\n        D. Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia.

Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

      "[['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old man with a 10-year history of medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoes an evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery.

T1 without contrast\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Both routine T2-weighted images and FLAIR images are useful, with FLAIR images being the most sensitive, for the demonstration of the abnormalities associated with hippocampal sclerosis defined on histopathologic examination. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old woman is seen for evaluation of intermittent spells concerning for seizures. The presence of which of the following characteristics of her spells would be more suggestive of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ictal eye closure\\n        B. opisthotonic posturing\\n        C. side-to-side head movements\\n        D. stuttering quality of speech\\n        E. tongue biting\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Characterization of spells as epileptic or psychogenic (ie, nonepileptic) in nature can be challenging and often requires video-EEG monitoring, although aspects of the history often help to distinguish the etiology of the episodes. Of the options listed above, tongue biting (or other types of injury/trauma) would be most suggestive of an epileptic nature. Other factors that would favor an epileptic etiology include significant postictal confusion, occurrence in sleep, and incontinence. The other choices listed above would all be more suggestive of a psychogenic nonepileptic etiology. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A patient with which of the following conditions should not be placed on a ketogenic diet?\\n        A. diabetes\\n        B. hyperlipidemia\\n        C. obesity\\n        D. pancreatitis\\n        E. Rett syndrome\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Ketogenic diets are contraindicated in patients with pancreatitis, hepatic failure, primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine palmitoyl transferase I and II deficiency, carnitine translocase deficiency, beta-oxidation defects, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and porphyria. In the intensive care setting where diet therapy is being considered for treatment of refractory status epilepticus, the ketogenic diet is also contraindicated in patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeds, including those with ileus, who are receiving a propofol infusion (to avoid fatal propofol infusion syndrome), and in patients who have metabolic, hemodynamic, or cardiorespiratory instability. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall. IV access is obtained. He is initially at his baseline neurologic status but then develops generalized seizure activity that has lasted 5 minutes.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n        A. focal cortical dysplasia\\n        B. neurofibromatosis\\n        C. Rasmussen encephalitis\\n        D. Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###']]\n"

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n                A. burst suppression\\n                B. generalized periodic discharges\\n                C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n                D. small sharp spikes\\n                E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n            -assistant:\\n            Answer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates).\\n            Therefore, the correct answer is  C.###', '-user:\\n            Question :  Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n                A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n                B. diffuse slow activity\\n                C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n                D. triphasic waves\\n                E. wicket spikes\\n            -assistant:\\n            Answer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke.

Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old woman with a history of complex partial epilepsy has been treated successfully with topiramate for 2 years. She is contemplating initiating birth control and comes to discuss her options with her physician. Which of the following would be a reasonable contraceptive choice for this patient?\\n        A. contraceptive hormonal patch\\n        B. intrauterine device\\n        C. low-dose combined oral contraceptive with estrogen and progestin components\\n        D. progestin-only oral contraceptive pill\\n        E. vaginal ring\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is content with her antiepileptic drug, and there is no compelling reason to change it. Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old man with a 10-year history of medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoes an evaluation for possible epilepsy surgery.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide).

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 25-year-old woman with a history of complex partial epilepsy has been treated successfully with topiramate for 2 years. She is contemplating initiating birth control and comes to discuss her options with her physician. Which of the following would be a reasonable contraceptive choice for this patient?\\n        A. contraceptive hormonal patch\\n        B. intrauterine device\\n        C. low-dose combined oral contraceptive with estrogen and progestin components\\n        D. progestin-only oral contraceptive pill\\n        E. vaginal ring\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is content with her antiepileptic drug, and there is no compelling reason to change it. Instead, she can choose a form of contraception that is compatible with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug such as topiramate. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings may provide insufficient protection. One of the various long-acting reversible contraceptives—which include progestin implants, IM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine devices—may be a good choice. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The cortical hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis display different MRI characteristics depending on a patient’s age. Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs. Dietary treatment with a ketogenic diet is proposed. What is the approximate percent chance that this patient will respond with a greater than 50% seizure reduction?\\n        A. 5%\\n        B. 10%\\n        C. 25%\\n        D. 50%\\n        E. 90%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that approximately 50% of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have greater than 50% reduction in seizures on the ketogenic diet. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms.

However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for long-term video-EEG monitoring. He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A patient with which of the following conditions should not be placed on a ketogenic diet?\\n        A. diabetes\\n        B. hyperlipidemia\\n        C. obesity\\n        D. pancreatitis\\n        E.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the most common side effect seen after placement of a vagus nerve stimulator?\\n        A. bradycardia\\n        B. device infection\\n        C. excessive cough\\n        D. vocal cord paralysis\\n        E. voice alteration/hoarseness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After placement of a vagus nerve stimulator, alteration of voice quality (including hoarseness) and excessive coughing are the most common side effects, seen in one study in about 66% and 45% of patients respectively. The other choices listed above are possible adverse effects of this procedure but are seen much less commonly. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall. IV access is obtained. He is initially at his baseline neurologic status but then develops generalized seizure activity that has lasted 5 minutes.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Which of the following pathophysiologic processes is responsible for this age-related change in the MRI characteristics of these lesions?\\n        A. breakdown of blood-brain barrier\\n        B. calcification\\n        C. inflammation\\n        D. myelination\\n        E. neovascularization\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cortical hamartomas (tubers) are the most characteristic lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex. These lesions can cause focal seizures, which in some patients may be refractory to antiepileptic drugs; however, not all tubers are epileptogenic. The MRI appearance of tubers changes with myelination. In neonates they are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding white matter. In older children they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images with poorly defined borders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy departed from its 1989 classification scheme of epilepsies and revised its seizure classification system. What was the primary goal of this change?\\n        A. advancement of a value system for syndromic severity\\n        B. grouping of patients’ diagnoses in a new classification structure\\n        C. keeping pace with advancing knowledge of epilepsy and seizures\\n        D. linkage of seizure manifestations with a cause\\n        E. modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While the advancement of a value system for syndromic severity and the modification of billing and coding practices with regard to epilepsy are desired goals, the overarching goal of revising the old classification scheme is to incorporate genetic, neuroimaging, and other new knowledge of epilepsy and seizures into a workable format for correct individual diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication.

Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

In the intensive care setting where diet therapy is being considered for treatment of refractory status epilepticus, the ketogenic diet is also contraindicated in patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeds, including those with ileus, who are receiving a propofol infusion (to avoid fatal propofol infusion syndrome), and in patients who have metabolic, hemodynamic, or cardiorespiratory instability. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 10-year-old child with epilepsy since age 2 that is refractory to medical treatment has been followed serially with brain MRI scans, which show progressive atrophy of the left hemisphere.

Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 30-year-old man who has had focal epilepsy for 15 years still experiences four to five episodes per month despite medication. He takes two anticonvulsants; his current medications are the ninth and tenth drugs he has tried. Repeated EEGs have shown a right temporal focus. He is on disability and lives with his parents. What is the next best step in management of this patient?\\n        A. addition of a third antiepileptic drug to his current regimen\\n        B. substitution of a new drug for one of his current antiepileptic drugs\\n        C. surgical evaluation\\n        D. transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n        E. vagus nerve stimulator trial\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Failure to respond adequately to proper trials of two anticonvulsants and presence of focal epilepsy should lead to a surgical evaluation. Vagus nerve stimulation is much less effective than surgery in this setting. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

He has multiple events while in the hospital, but no clear abnormality is apparent on the EEG. Which of the following characteristics may still support a diagnosis of epileptic seizures as opposed to psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. ability for events to be induced or suggested\\n        B. high-amplitude, thrashing motor activity\\n        C. lack of events occurring in sleep\\n        D. prolonged alterations in level of alertness\\n        E. stereotyped nature of events\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  There are some limitations on the ability of video-EEG monitoring to definitively make a diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic. Similarly, in the setting of a reassuring EEG, the other options listed above (suggestibility, prolonged alterations in consciousness, lack of sleep-related events) would all be more suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy. She is concerned about seizures becoming more frequent during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 63-year-old woman is hospitalized with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Which of the following EEG patterns is most likely to be seen in this patient?\\n        A. burst suppression\\n        B. generalized periodic discharges\\n        C. periodic lateralizing discharges\\n        D. small sharp spikes\\n        E. stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Periodic lateralizing discharges are EEG abnormalities commonly seen in certain scenarios, including herpes encephalitis. Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following EEG patterns is rarely seen in normal patients and has a high specificity for temporal lobe epilepsy?\\n        A. 14 and 6 positive spikes\\n        B. diffuse slow activity\\n        C. rhythmic temporal delta\\n        D. triphasic waves\\n        E. wicket spikes\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, rhythmic temporal delta activity is most suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely. Wicket spikes and 14 and 6 positive spikes are considered normal EEG variants seen in older adults and adolescents, respectively. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Deep brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy targets which of the following structures?\\n        A. anterior nucleus of the thalamus\\n        B. centromedian nucleus of the thalamus\\n        C. cingulate gyrus\\n        D. hippocampus\\n        E. internal segment of the globus pallidus\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is therefore believed to be a relay station for information passing from the amygdala and hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following seizure/epilepsy subtypes appears to respond best to deep brain stimulation techniques?\\n        A. absence seizures\\n        B. frontal lobe epilepsy\\n        C. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\\n        D. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate.

Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 21-year-old man is seen in clinic for management of seizures. He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 66-year-old woman is seen in clinic for a new diagnosis of epilepsy; she has experienced recurrent partial seizures attributed to a left hemispheric stroke. Her medical history is most notable for atrial fibrillation (for which she takes warfarin), osteoporosis, and a history of kidney stones. Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam.

Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Other conditions in which periodic lateralizing discharges are seen include focal brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, and theophylline exposure. Generalized periodic discharges are more commonly seen in anoxic brain injury, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other diffuse processes. Stimulus-induced, rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are most commonly seen in critically ill patients, even those without neurologic illness. Burst suppression is typically seen in anoxic encephalopathy or in the setting of certain medications (eg, propofol, barbiturates). \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia. In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations. In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Surgery for which of the following types of epilepsy is least likely to result in seizure freedom?\\n        A. epilepsy due to a hemispheric syndrome\\n        B. epilepsy due to neonatal infarct\\n        C. epilepsy due to tumor\\n        D. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\\n        E. nonlesional neocortical epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The best outcomes from epilepsy surgery are for temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis, lesional resections, and hemispherectomy, with lower seizure-free rates in patients with nonlesional neocortical resections. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is a possible predictor of refractory status epilepticus (status epilepticus not responding to two antiepileptic medications)?\\n        A. convulsive status epilepticus\\n        B. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\\n        C. older age\\n        D. prior stroke\\n        E. underlying malignancy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Some etiologies of status epilepticus or patient factors may be more predictive of a refractory course that does not respond to initial treatments. Of the options listed above, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (and other etiologies that are not associated with an underlying structural lesion) may be more likely to be refractory. Encephalitis, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and subtle symptoms as a manifestation of status epilepticus are other possible predictors. Physicians should be aware that these etiologies of status epilepticus may require more aggressive treatment. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : According to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 2010 revision of its seizure classification system, which of the following factors is most helpful in initially focusing the scope of diagnostic possibilities for specific electroclinical syndromes?\\n        A. age at onset\\n        B. family seizure history\\n        C. frequency of spells\\n        D. history of toxic exposure\\n        E. severity of the disorder\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  While all the other factors mentioned should be part of an initial seizure history, they are not as important in establishing the ultimate diagnosis. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG.

In addition, of the medications listed above, valproate is also associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed during pregnancy, as measured by lower IQ at age 6 and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following antiepileptic drug combinations is most likely to result in symptoms of diplopia and dizziness?\\n        A. phenobarbital and valproate\\n        B. phenytoin and carbamazepine\\n        C. phenytoin and gabapentin\\n        D. topiramate and carbamazepine\\n        E. valproate and lamotrigine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The combination of phenytoin and carbamazepine frequently results in the adverse effects of dizziness and diplopia.

Sturge-Weber syndrome\\n        E. tuberous sclerosis\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  MRI in Rasmussen encephalitis shows progressive atrophy of one of the cerebral hemispheres, usually beginning in the opercular region. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : The presence of a photoparoxysmal response to photic stimulation during an EEG is most commonly seen in which of the following settings?\\n        A. cognitively normal patients\\n        B. occipital lobe epilepsy\\n        C. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        D. sleep-deprived patients\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The photoparoxysmal response is an abnormal response seen in the setting of photic stimulation and goes beyond the “photic driving” of the posterior dominant rhythm seen in cognitively normal patients. It can be seen in different types of epilepsy but is most commonly seen in primary generalized epilepsies, especially childhood absence epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###']]\n"
