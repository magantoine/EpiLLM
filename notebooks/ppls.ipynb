Data have shown that inhibition of the anterior nucleus may result in prevention or cessation of seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following conditions would likely preclude the consideration of epilepsy surgery in a patient?\\n        A. dominant hemisphere focus\\n        B. low-grade tumor\\n        C. mental retardation\\n        D. primary generalized epilepsy\\n        E. prior vagus nerve stimulator use\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Patients who are typically not surgical candidates include those with clear evidence of bilateral onset of habitual seizures, those with severe psychiatric or medical comorbidities increasing surgical risk or compromising recovery, those with rapidly progressive CNS disease, and those with primary generalized epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following is the major role of the neurologist after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events?\\n        A. appropriately weaning antiepileptic drugs\\n        B. describing events in ambiguous terms\\n        C. ensuring that patients continue to refrain from driving a motor vehicle\\n        D. ordering follow-up EEG in 6 to 12 months\\n        E. prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other antidepressant\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  After a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, one of the major roles of the neurologist is the rational weaning of antiepileptic medications. This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated. While mental health care is often needed, the routine prescription of antidepressants is not always indicated. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. After some initial improvement in his neurologic status, he has become a bit less responsive. EEG shows fluctuating right greater than left periodic discharges at 1 to 2 Hz without definite evolution. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\\n        A. 0.1 mg/kg IV lorazepam\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. observation with repeat 30-minute EEG in 24 hours\\n        D. oral levetiracetam\\n        E. sequential small doses of midazolam or other IV antiepileptic drug until the EEG pattern resolves\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is increasingly being identified as a cause of altered mental status in critically ill patients, including patients with structural brain lesions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists.

She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury.

Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\\n        E. temporal lobe epilepsy\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  In pivotal studies of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy responded best to this treatment approach. Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

He has had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity with resultant oral trauma and incontinence. Some of his events may have started with focal shaking in the right arm, although this history is unclear and is unable to be corroborated. EEG reveals no epileptiform activity or asymmetry, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Of the following anticonvulsants, which would be most appropriate for this patient?\\n        A. gabapentin\\n        B. lacosamide\\n        C. oxcarbazepine\\n        D. phenobarbital\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of this patient’s episodes is consistent with generalized seizures. However, based on the history, EEG, and imaging studies, it is hard to determine whether these events are primary or secondary generalized in nature. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether seizures are primary generalized or focal in onset, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant medication is preferable. Of the options listed above, zonisamide and phenobarbital are both considered broad-spectrum drugs, although zonisamide would be preferable based on its more favorable side-effect profile. Oxcarbazepine and gabapentin are more narrow-spectrum and would only be indicated if the events were more clearly focal in onset. The exact spectrum of lacosamide is unknown at this time, since it has only been studied in the setting of focal seizures. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical factors is most predictive of cognitive decline after epilepsy surgery?\\n        A. higher preoperative cognitive performance\\n        B. presence of hippocampal sclerosis\\n        C. surgery on nonlanguage dominant hemisphere\\n        D. younger age at seizure onset\\n        E. younger age at time of surgery\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cognitive performance may improve in some patients after surgery, presumably related to better seizure control and possible decrease in the burden of anticonvulsants needed for seizure control. However, even with functional imaging or Wada testing to guide treatment decisions, some patients will note worsened cognitive functioning postoperatively. Of the options listed, patients with higher preoperative cognitive functioning are at a higher risk of new cognitive difficulties after surgery. Older age at seizure onset and at time of surgery, the lack of hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and surgery on the language-dominant hemisphere are other predictors of postoperative cognitive symptoms. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Patients with this form of epilepsy had a 44% reduction in seizures (compared to 22% in controls); patients with seizures originating from other lobes had no significant effect from this procedure. One possible explanation for this finding is the connection between the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus as part of the Papez circuit. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following clinical characteristics is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy?\\n        A. coexistent depression\\n        B. higher frequency of seizures\\n        C. lower reported quality of life\\n        D. male sex\\n        E. partial-onset seizures\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Among many potential predictors, only the presence of a coexisting mood disorder such as major depression is associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide.

In addition, both medications have enzyme-inducing properties, resulting in complex pharmacologic interactions and difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. Phenobarbital and valproate have a higher likelihood of resulting in weight gain. Combining valproate and lamotrigine may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so dosing adjustments need to be made carefully. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy.

Her primary care physician started her on phenytoin, which resulted in a rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate antiepileptic medication for this patient?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. levetiracetam\\n        C. primidone\\n        D. valproate\\n        E. zonisamide\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with epilepsy is medically complex, with several notable comorbid medical conditions and a prior adverse reaction to phenytoin. Using either carbamazepine or primidone in this case would be challenging given the potential cross-reactivity with phenytoin (to which she has already had a hypersensitive reaction) as well as the potential drug-drug interactions with warfarin. Zonisamide is associated with a risk of kidney stones and should be avoided in this patient with prior calculi. Valproate and enzyme-inducing medications are associated with accelerated loss of bone density, which is already a concern in this patient with osteoporosis. Of the options listed, levetiracetam has the lowest risk of hypersensitivity, drug-drug interactions with warfarin, and potential worsening of her underlying osteoporosis and kidney stones. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : In addition to a risk of major congenital malformations, which of the following antiepileptic drugs is also associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorders and lower IQ at age 6?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenobarbital\\n        D. phenytoin\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Women treated with valproate (either monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptics) are at elevated risk of giving birth to children with major congenital malformations.

While sensitivity for this finding is not especially high, it is rarely seen outside of the context of temporal lobe seizures and therefore carries high specificity. Triphasic waves are most commonly seen in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. Diffuse slow activity is seen in patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, and other processes that affect the brain more diffusely.

Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future.

Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome.

Events with subtle, subjective symptoms (eg, simple partial seizures or auras) may involve only a small area of cortex and may not be detected by a surface EEG. Events of this type that are highly stereotyped in nature may still represent epileptic events despite the lack of EEG findings during monitoring. Thrashing motor activity can sometimes obscure the EEG because of motion artifact, but the semiology of these events usually allows for them to be characterized as nonepileptic.

Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

The persistent mental status change is suggestive of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial management consists of sequential administration of low-dose benzodiazepines (preferably short-acting agents, such as midazolam) or IV administration of a relatively nonsedating antiepileptic medication (such as levetiracetam or lacosamide). After initiation of these medications, improvement in the clinical state and EEG is supportive of a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initiation of additional antiepileptics should be held until the diagnosis is clearer. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 60-year-old woman develops generalized seizure activity lasting 10 minutes; seizure activity appears to arrest after administration of 4 mg of IV lorazepam. She has chronic kidney disease but is otherwise in good health. Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall. IV access is obtained. He is initially at his baseline neurologic status but then develops generalized seizure activity that has lasted 5 minutes.

IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Although not all data are available for all drugs (and keeping in mind that an individual patient may have other specific needs), which of the following antiepileptic drugs would be the best initial choice in an adolescent girl with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. ethosuximide\\n        C. lacosamide\\n        D. valproic acid\\n        E. levetiracetam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Levetiracetam is considered to be effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Carbamazepine is probably better in partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide has strong evidence in absence seizures. Valproic acid is effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and related seizure types but is usually not the first choice in adolescent girls because of teratogenicity and risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. Lacosamide has no data for myoclonic epilepsy. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Fetal exposure to which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with decreased IQ during childhood?\\n        A. carbamazepine\\n        B. lamotrigine\\n        C. phenytoin\\n        D. topiramate\\n        E. valproate\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Of the options listed above, in utero exposure to valproate is most likely to be associated with a lower childhood IQ. Longitudinal studies have shown no changes with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, but a lower mean IQ at age 3 was seen with exposure to valproate. This was also shown to have a dose-effect response, with lower IQs observed in children exposed to higher doses of valproate. There is no data on cognitive outcomes in children with in utero exposure to topiramate. Unlike valproate, topiramate does not cause apoptosis in immature brains of animals. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with interictal spikes or epileptiform abnormalities on EEG?\\n        A. cefepime\\n        B. doxycycline\\n        C. fluoxetine\\n        D. methylphenidate\\n        E. modafinil\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Cefepime is one of several medications that can be associated with interictal spikes on EEG. Other examples include bupropion, lithium, tramadol, and clozapine. Uremia, thyrotoxicosis, and some other medical comorbidities can also be associated with epileptiform abnormalities but are not diagnostic for epilepsy. Abnormal EEGs in these contexts need to be interpreted with appropriate caution. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : A 40-year-old woman is admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of paroxysmal episodes of neurologic dysfunction. Her episodes involve some nonrhythmic shaking of both arms and pelvic thrusting without any correlate on the EEG; psychogenic nonepileptic events are diagnosed. Which of the following characteristics is most associated with a good outcome (ie, resolution of episodes)?\\n        A. episodes with prominent motor features\\n        B. female gender\\n        C. lower educational achievement\\n        D. older age at diagnosis\\n        E. shorter duration of illness\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  The description of the events provided above and the lack of EEG findings during her episodes are both suggestive of nonepileptic events. Prognosis after a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic events is variable but may be dependent on certain characteristics. Of the options listed above, a shorter duration of illness (ie, shorter time between the onset of spells and the diagnosis of nonepileptic events) is most predictive of a positive outcome. Some of the other options listed above (older age, prominent/dramatic motor features, lower educational achievement) are associated with a poorer outcome after a diagnosis of nonepileptic events. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman with longstanding complex partial seizures, well controlled on monotherapy with carbamazepine, is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling of this patient regarding her pregnancy and seizure recurrence?\\n        A. most women experience a decrease in seizure frequency\\n        B. most women experience an increase in seizure frequency\\n        C. most women experience no change in seizure frequency\\n        D. seizures are least likely to occur in the third trimester\\n        E. seizures are more likely to be generalized in nature\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Although the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable, most women with epilepsy do not experience a significant change in the number or severity of their seizures. Expected physiologic hormonal changes, alterations in sleep and other routines, and other factors can alter the seizure frequency in some cases. Noncompliance can also play a role, since some women will discontinue their medications with the assumption that the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medications outweigh their potential benefits. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 76-year-old man is admitted with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.

This should be done with the caveat that coexistent epilepsy may also be present, so the physician needs to keep an open mind regarding new events (although routine surveillance EEGs are not necessarily indicated). Driving restrictions should be handled on an individual case basis, although most patients can return to driving with little chance of injury. Neurologists should use unambiguous terms when describing the diagnosis to the patient and other providers so that the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is not perpetuated.

Other characteristics, including age, sex, seizure type, seizure control, duration of epilepsy, and lower quality of life, have not been associated with a higher risk of suicide. Because of this, routine screening for depression and suicidality in patients with epilepsy is recommended. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###'], ['-user:\\nQuestion : Approximately what percentage of patients with epilepsy will become seizure free on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen?\\n        A. 10%\\n        B. 40%\\n        C. 60%\\n        D. 80%\\n        E. 95%\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Data suggest that 35% to 40% of patients will be well controlled on the initial antiepileptic drug regimen chosen for them. Once a patient is well controlled, both the patient and physician may be reluctant to make changes in the regimen, even if there is good rationale for making an adjustment. This underscores the importance of making a wise initial choice in an antiepileptic medication because there may be limited ability to make changes in the future. This choice must weigh data on effectiveness, adverse effects, teratogenicity, and patient compliance, among other considerations. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : Which of the following best describes the relationship between vagus nerve stimulation and risk of bradycardia?\\n        A. can be seen with stimulation of either nerve\\n        B. higher risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        C. lowest risk seen with bilateral stimulation\\n        D. no risk with left nerve stimulation\\n        E. no risk with right nerve stimulation\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve originating from the nucleus ambiguous include cardiac branches that help control heart rhythms. Since fibers originating from the right vagus nerve primarily innervate the sinoatrial node, it was thought that right nerve stimulation (or bilateral stimulation) may be most likely to cause bradycardia. However, at certain stimulator settings, even stimulation of the left vagus nerve (which primarily innervates the atrioventricular node) may precipitate bradycardia. Neurologists involved in programming stimulators should be aware that bradycardia can be a risk with stimulation of either nerve. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 6-year-old child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically resistant epilepsy is currently on two anticonvulsants and still has several seizures daily despite trials of more than five antiepileptic drugs.

Which of the following is the best next pharmacological step in management?\\n        A. continuous midazolam infusion\\n        B. continuous propofol infusion\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV ketamine\\n        E. IV phenobarbital\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  Regardless of whether prolonged seizure activity stops after the administration of an appropriate dose of a benzodiazepine, rapid administration of a longer-acting anticonvulsant is generally recommended. This allows for prevention of additional seizures as the effect of the benzodiazepine wears off over the course of several hours. Of the options listed, fosphenytoin is the preferred option. A continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam is not indicated in this setting unless clinical or EEG evidence of ongoing seizures (ie, refractory status epilepticus) exists. If the patient does not wake up rapidly, an urgent EEG should be obtained. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 27-year-old woman is seen in clinic for ongoing management of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Her seizures have been well controlled on lamotrigine, with no seizures in the past 2 years. She does report some symptoms of depression, as well as anticipatory anxiety regarding the possibility of future seizures. Which of the following options is the best next step in management?\\n        A. bupropion\\n        B. citalopram\\n        C. nortriptyline\\n        D. taper off lamotrigine and begin levetiracetam\\n        E. venlafaxine\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient is reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety, both of which are common in patients with epilepsy. In patients requiring pharmacotherapy for these symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram are considered first-line treatments because of lower likelihood of additional side effects and minimal drug-drug interactions. Venlafaxine is another option if an SSRI is not tolerated, and tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline) could be considered if neither of these first two agents is successful. Lamotrigine is not commonly associated with depression and is often used as a mood stabilizer; it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms in this patient and should not be changed to levetiracetam. Bupropion is associated with a higher risk of seizures and should not be used. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.###', '-user:\\nQuestion : A 33-year-old man with known epilepsy is seen in the emergency department after a seizure with an associated fall. IV access is obtained. He is initially at his baseline neurologic status but then develops generalized seizure activity that has lasted 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\\n        A. buccal midazolam\\n        B. IV diazepam\\n        C. IV fosphenytoin\\n        D. IV lorazepam\\n        E. rectal diazepam\\n-assistant:\\nAnswer :  This patient with underlying epilepsy has had continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes and meets criteria for status epilepticus. In patients with IV access, IV lorazepam is considered the initial treatment of choice. It has been shown to be more effective than IV diazepam or phenytoin. In patients without IV access, administration of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam can be considered. \\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.###']]\n"

The most common cause of occipital calcifications is neurocysticercosis, which can be diagnosed by serologic testing for tissue transglutaminase antibody. Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies are associated with limbic encephalitis and other autoimmune disorders but not with neurocysticercosis.
